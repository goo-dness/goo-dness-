🚀 My Developer Learning Journey

## 👋 About Me
Self-taught developer from Nigeria, currently mastering backend development, system engineering and network programming. 
I learn by building - every project teaches me something new.

## 🎯 Current Mission (April 2026- June 2026)
Building **Book Network** - A social platform for book lovers with semantic search powered by AI.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **AI/ML:** Sentence Transformers (for semantic search)
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, VS Code

## 📚 What I've Built So Far

### Small Projects (Learning Phase)
- **Contacts Manager** - CLI app for managing contacts (Python)
- **Quiz Game** - Interactive quiz with scoring (Python)
- **Number Guessing Game** - Classic game with hints (Python)

*These taught me: data structures, control flow, functions, user input*

### Future Project
**Book Network Platform** (In Progress)
- Full-stack web application
- Users can discover books, write reviews, create reading lists
- **Unique feature:** Semantic search that understands meaning, not just keywords
- Expected launch: June 2026

## 🛠️ Skills I'm Developing

**Languages:** Python,semantics search, Django, etc. 
**Backend:** Django, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, Authentication (JWT)  
**Frontend:** React, Hooks, Routing, State Management  
**AI/ML:** Natural Language Processing, Vector Embeddings  
**Other:** Git/GitHub, Linux, Command Line, Problem Solving

## 📖 Learning Resources I'm Using
- Books, w3school.
- freeCodeCamp (React course)
- Sentence Transformers documentation
- Django & React official docs
- Stack Overflow (when I'm stuck!)

## 🎓 My Learning Philosophy
*"Build to learn, not learn to build."*

I don't just watch tutorials - I code along, break things, fix them, and understand WHY it works.

## 📅 Milestones and future plans

- [x] **Oct 2025:** Completed Python fundamentals, built CLI projects
- [ ] **Dec 2025:** Master Django & REST APIs
- [ ] **Feb 2026:** Learn React, connect frontend to backend
- [ ] **May 2026:** Implement semantic search with ML
- [ ] **June 2026:** Deploy Book Network, buy laptop (₦400k saved!)
- [ ] **May 2026:** Start freelancing
- [ ] **Jun 2026:** First remote job or client

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Django REST Framework (building APIs)
- React fundamentals (components, state, hooks)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector (for storing embeddings)
- Machine Learning basics (sentence transformers)

## 💡 What's Next?
After Book Network launches, I plan to:
- Build a portfolio website
- Contribute to open source
- Start freelancing on Upwork/Fiverr
- Build an educational platform 
- Contribute to solving the global goals.
